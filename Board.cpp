Otherwise, it will return true after setting the number of beans in the indicated hole or pot to the value of the third parameter. (This may change what beansInPlay and totalBeans return if they are called later.) This function exists solely so that we and you can more easily test your program: None of your code that implements the member functions of any class is allowed to call this function directly or indirectly. (We'll show an example of its use below.)
